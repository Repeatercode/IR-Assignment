      "abstract": "Identifying influential nodes in social networks − by determining the most effective and efficient set of primary users − is a crucial task for maximizing the spread of influence. The competitive world of social networks and the variety of services they provide have persuaded users to apply for the membership of several networks. This situation makes involvement of the shared individuals across multiple social networks essential for the effective dissemination of information. In this paper, we introduce a community-based entropic method to identify influential nodes in multiple social networks, taking into account the effect of shared users. The proposed method, titled IM2-SE, focuses on calculating a total structural entropy for each node. This structural entropy is defined as the weighted sum of the structural entropies of the node in the networks and in the communities, it belongs to. The structural entropy of a node is based on Tsallis entropy considering both local and global structures of the network, and it utilizes the degree of centrality and betweenness centrality. Then, the nodes with the highest total structural entropy are identified as the influential nodes. The empirical evaluation of the proposed method on the real-world datasets including homogeneous and heterogeneous networks, demonstrates its superior performance to the baseline methods. Furthermore, the impact of the shared nodes between networks in identifying the influential nodes has been examined, revealing that up to 50% of the identified influential nodes are the shared nodes between specific networks."

      "abstract": "COVID-19 poses a complex and unprecedented challenge to public health and society, requiring scientific efforts to understand, model, diagnose, and control the disease. The integration of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) with epidemiological models offers a powerful tool for understanding the dynamics of infectious diseases and developing effective strategies to control and mitigate their impact. In this study, we develop a novel hybrid approach to modelling and forecasting the dynamics and the demand for healthcare resources. We take advantage of the concept of PINNs to capture the dynamics of infectious diseases, estimate key parameters, and unobserved states in the ability of the model, using the neural network to integrate physical laws directly into the learning process of a modified compartmental model. We also make use of the strength of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to combine data generated by a PINN and lagged covariates of target variables to forecast demand from the intensive care unit demand using different variations of RNN models. The results indicate that our proposed hybrid framework is highly effective in capturing the dynamics of the pandemic and providing insight into the dynamics of the disease."

      "abstract": "The obnoxious p-median problem is a facility location problem where we maximise the sum of the distances between each client point and its nearest facility. Since it is nondeterministic polynomial-time (NP)-hard, most algorithms designed for the problem follow metaheuristic strategies to find high-quality solutions in affordable time but with no optimality guarantee. In this paper, a variant of the iterated greedy algorithm is developed for the problem. It adopts the idea of increasing the search radius used in variable neighbourhood search by increasing the number of reconstructed components at each iteration with no improved solution, where the amount of the increase is determined dynamically based on the quality of the current solution. We demonstrate that the new algorithm significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art metaheuristic algorithms for this problem on standard datasets."

      "abstract": "Integrating renewable energy sources into the power distribution grid challenges protection system operation, leading to protection blinding when circuit breakers fail to trip due to fault current contribution from these sources. Communication-based adaptive protection can address this issue, but communication system components like sensors can fail. This research proposes a genetic algorithm-based approach to optimally place redundant sensors, minimizing protection blinding under communication uncertainty within a redundancy budget. The fault tolerance, measured by a new metric called redundancy degree, reflects the number of redundant components deployed. Results demonstrate the algorithm’s effectiveness in optimizing redundant sensor locations, reducing system costs, and improving fault tolerance. For the system and scenarios investigated, an average of 60% redundant sensors are relocated, reducing the average protection trip time by 36.65% compared to a baseline approach that does not consider communication uncertainty. This encourages incorporating communication component failure considerations in power system planning."

Inspired by the swarm intelligence behavior of the ant colony optimization, we propose a workload scheduler for the arriving demand agents to increase local resource utilization and reduce communication costs without relying on a centralized scheduler. Like the ants, the demand agents will release pheromones on the resource agent to indicate the available resources. The next arriving demand agent will most probably choose a neighbor, following the pheromone value and communication cost. The framework’s performance is evaluated in terms of local resource utilization, dependency on fog and cloud, and communication cost. We compare these metrics for the ant-inspired algorithm with random and greedy algorithms.The simulation results reveal that the proposed algorithm inspired by swarm intelligence can increase resource utilization at the edge and reduce the dependency on higher layers, while also decreasing the communication cost for the task of resource allocation"

      "abstract": "Protection blinding is a challenging issue in renewables-penetrated distribution grids and refers to a situation where a circuit breaker may not trip due to fault current contribution from distributed generation. This research addresses how the distributed generation location and capacity impact the operation of the circuit breaker in terms of the response time of the circuit breakers. The relative electrical distances of the faults and distributed generation to the circuit breakers are considered. The impact of distributed generation capacity considering the fault location is characterized using a new index called the heterogeneity index. The electrical distance between distributed generations and circuit breakers and the electrical distance between fault and circuit breaker is considered by a second new index called the electrical distance ratio. Data analysis on simulation results shows that these indices capture the phenomena of protection blinding caused by distributed generation. Results show that a higher distributed generation penetration and faults that are electrically further away from a circuit breaker show severe cases of protection blinding captured by the indices. Furthermore, it is demonstrated how these indices can identify the worst impacted locations in the distribution grid. A key result is that protection blinding does not necessarily occur solely due to the presence of distributed generation between a circuit breaker and a fault, but is dependent on factors such as distributed generation location in the distribution grid, fault level, fault level distribution across the generation units and fault location."

      "abstract": "We suggest interaction-CASCADE as a combined model by extending the CASCADE as a probabilistic high-level model to consider the underlying components’ failure interaction graph, which could be derived using detailed models. In interaction-CASCADE, the total incurred overload after each component failure is the same as the CASCADE; however, the overload transfers to the out neighbors of the failed component given by the interaction graph. We first assume that the component’s initial loads are independent of their out- and in-degrees in the interaction graph and show that even though the process’s dynamics depend on the interaction graphs’ structure, the critical load beyond which the probability of total failure is significant does not change. We then discuss that assigning the lighter loads to components with higher in-degrees can shift the minimum critical load to higher values. Simulation results for random Erdős-Rényi and power-law degree distributed are provided and discussed."

      "abstract": "Marfan syndrome (MS) is a genetic disorder often associated with the development of aortic aneurysms, leading to severe vascular complications. The progression of this condition is intricately linked to hemodynamic factors such as wall shear stress (WSS) and von Mises stress, as abnormal distributions can contribute to thrombus formation, endothelial damage, and the worsening of aneurysmal conditions. In this study, six vascular models were analyzed: four representing diseased aortas with Marfan syndrome aneurysms and two healthy aortic models for comparison. The models were sourced from Vascular Model Repository, and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were conducted using a Newtonian fluid model and the shear stress transport (SST) k- ω turbulent transitional model to evaluate WSS and von Mises stress. Fluid-structure interaction was employed to incorporate vessel wall interaction, and pulsatile inlet velocity profiles were used to simulate physiological blood flow, capturing time-dependent hemodynamic variations. The results revealed significant differences between healthy and diseased aortic models. In healthy models, WSS was uniformly distributed, with values consistently below 40 Pa, reflecting stable vascular conditions. Conversely, the diseased models exhibited highly non-uniform WSS distributions, with notably lower values in aneurysmal regions, contributing to thrombus formation, with elevated WSS in areas like the carotid and subclavian arteries due to geometric and hemodynamic complexities. The von Mises stress analysis identified regions of heightened rupture risk, particularly on the superior side of case MS 1 , where both von Mises stress and WSS reached their highest values among all cases. Physics-informed neural networks demonstrated strong agreement with CFD results while significantly reducing computational cost, highlighting their potential for real-time clinical applications. These findings underscore the critical role of hemodynamic factors in aneurysm progression and rupture risk, offering valuable insights for optimizing diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in vascular diseases."

      "abstract": "In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, it was essential to accurately forecast the demand for hospitalisation resources to achieve an effective allocation of healthcare resources. This paper explores the potential of various Deep Learning (DL) models, namely basic Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), Bidirectional RNNs, and Sequence-to-Sequence architectures with the inclusion of attention mechanisms, to forecast the demand for hospitalisation resources (mechanical ventilators) in England during the COVID-19 pandemic. The implementation of simulated annealing (SA) as a hyperparameter tuning method produced certain model structures and good results in terms of prediction accuracy. Our findings show that the LSTM-based models (LSTM_SA), achieved the lowest mean average error (MAE), outperforming other architectures used in this study. The results of this study show the potential of DL models to forecast the demand for resources and could help inform the distribution of hospitalisation resources in England during the COVID-19 pandemic."

This research uses computational techniques to better understand how medical resources can be allocated to controlling pandemics. Mathematical modelling techniques are used to study the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases, and to estimate the cost of implementing control measures. A mathematical model is used to solve problem statements drawn from assumptions. Optimizing the allocation of resources can be achieved by using algorithms to optimise the cost of distributing resources in order to control a pandemic. The goal of this research would be to find the most cost-effective algorithm, utilizing all operational research methodologies. In general, the product is software that implements the best algorithm designed to deal with the problem of resource allocation for pandemics."

      "abstract": "The emotion–cause pair extraction (ECPE) task is to simultaneously extract emotions and causes as pairs (EC-pairs) from documents, which is important for natural language processing. Previous research tackled this task via a two-step approach, which first predicts separately the emotion and cause clauses, and then pairs them up by using a binary classifier. However, such a two-step approach may suffer from the possible propagation of errors, and it neglects the interaction between emotions and causes. In this article, an end-to-end double-graph method with relational enhancement (DGRE) is proposed to stimulate two relationship modes among clauses, i.e., semantic dependence and logical dependence. First, two united graph encoders are established to embed the semantic dependence into the representation of clauses and pairs. The first encoder is built on graph attention networks (GATs) for clause-level representation, the result of which is used by a relational graph convolutional network (RGCN) for the refinement of pair-level representation. Aiming to enhance the fitting ability of logical dependence, the emotion-type classification task is introduced into the multitask learning framework of GATs, which can effectively distinguish the logical relations between clauses according to their emotion types. Moreover, seven types of dependence relations have been designed for the node connections in RGCN, which emphasize the contextual interaction and clustering among neighboring nodes. Experiments on a benchmark Chinese corpus demonstrate that the proposed DGRE approach could effectively establish the communication mechanism between clauses and pairs from multiple perspectives, and comparisons with state-of-the-art (SOTA) models well validate its effectiveness."

      "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) plays a pivotal role in Industry 4.0, with predictive maintenance (PdM) emerging as a core application for improving operational efficiency by reducing unplanned downtime and extending asset life. Despite these advancements, the black-box nature of AI models remains a significant barrier to adoption, as industry stakeholders require systems that are both transparent and trustworthy. This study presents a systematic literature review examining how human-in-the-loop explainable AI (HITL-XAI) approaches can enhance the effectiveness and adoption of AI systems in PdM contexts. This review followed the PRISMA methodology, employing predefined search strings across Scopus, ProQuest, and EBSCO databases. Sixty-three peer-reviewed journal articles, published between 2019 and early 2025, were included in the final analysis. The selected studies span various domains, including industrial manufacturing, energy, and transportation, with findings synthesized through both descriptive and thematic analyses. A key gap identified is the limited empirical exploration of generative AI (GenAI) in improving the usability, interpretability, and trustworthiness of HITL-XAI systems in PdM applications. This review outlines actionable insights for integrating explainability and GenAI into existing rule-based PdM systems to support more adaptive and reliable maintenance strategies. Ultimately, the findings underscore the importance of designing HITL-XAI systems that not only demonstrate high model performance but are also effectively aligned with operational workflows and the cognitive needs of maintenance personnel."

      "abstract": "Modelling the hydro-morphodynamics of mangrove environments poses significant challenges due to their complex geometry, dynamic vegetation-water interactions, and limited in situ measurements. Traditional numerical models struggle in such settings due to high computational cost, the need for extensive mesh generation, and difficulties in assimilating heterogeneous data sources. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes a hybrid Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) framework that integrates governing physical laws, satellite-derived vegetation data, and outputs from high- resolution Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations of the Sundarbans mangrove system. The proposed hybrid PINN model incorporates shallow water flow and sediment transport equations into the loss function and uses a temporal causality weighting mechanism to improve convergence in time-dependent domains. Model outputs include elevation, flow velocity, and suspended sediment concentration. The model is trained using a small subset of CFD simulation data and validated against a traditional finite element (FE) solver and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) baseline. The proposed hybrid PINNs model achieved RMSE values in the range of 10 −2 for elevation and velocity and 10 −3 for sediment concentration, significantly outperforming the CNN model, particularly in generalising to unseen time steps. Compared to the FE model, the proposed framework achieved a five-fold reduction in training time (24 h vs. 5 days) and supports inference within seconds, enabling near real-time predictions. The mesh-free structure of the model, combined with its physics-regularised learning, also facilitates adaptation to other coastal or mangrove systems governed by similar dynamics. This hybrid approach offers a robust, generalisable surrogate for high-fidelity coastal simulations in data-scarce and computationally demanding environments."

      "abstract": "Dementia, including Alzheimer’s disease and frontotemporal dementia, is a progres- sive brain disorder that disrupts memory, thinking, and behavior, with early diagnosis being critical for effective intervention. This study examines the alteration of brain activity caused by dementia by analyzing electroencephalogram (EEG) signals using an infor- mation geometry method known as information rate, which captures the evolving pat- terns of brain signals over time rather than relying on static averages. This method is applied across standard EEG frequency bands – delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma – in participants with dementia and healthy controls. The characteristics of the distribu- tion of information rate are studied through the statistical moments (such as mean, vari- ance, skewness, and kurtosis) and Shannon entropy. The statistical comparisons are accessed using the Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s post-hoc analysis, and results are compared against a conventional average-base method using Jensen-Shannon distance. The results show that dynamic features of EEG signals – particularly in the theta, alpha, and beta bands – effectively distinguish Alzheimer’s patients from healthy individuals, while the Shannon entropy of signal dynamics in frontal region differentiates frontotem- poral dementia patients across the theta to gamma bands. Moreover, changes in the occipital region detected by information rate, but not by traditional method, further high- light the importance of capturing temporal variability. The method also successfully dis- tinguishes individuals with Mild Cognitive Impairment from healthy controls, which con- ventional analysis failed to achieve. These results suggest that analyzing the dynamics properties of the brain signals provides a more sensitive and informative approach for identifying and distinguishing various forms of dementia."

      "abstract": "The prospect of future treatment warrants the development of cost-effective screening for Alzheimer's disease (AD). A promising candidate in this regard is electroencephalography (EEG), as it is one of the most economic imaging modalities. Recent efforts in EEG analysis have shifted towards leveraging spatial information, employing novel frameworks such as graph signal processing or graph neural networks. Here, we investigate the importance of spatial information relative to spectral or temporal information by varying the proportion of each dimension for AD classification. To do so, we systematically test various dimension resolution configurations on two routine EEG datasets. Our findings show that spatial information is more important than temporal information and equally valuable as spectral information. On the larger second dataset, substituting spectral with spatial information even led to an increase of 1.1% in accuracy, which emphasises the importance of spatial information for EEG-based AD classification. We argue that our resolution-based feature extraction has the potential to improve AD classification specifically, and multivariate signal classification generally.Clinical relevance - This study proposes balancing the spectral, temporal and spatial feature resolution to improve EEGbased diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases."

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Digital health is a critical driver of quality, safety, and efficiency in health care. However, poor quality of clinical information in digital health technologies (DHTs) can compromise the quality and safety of care. The Clinical Information Quality (CLIQ) framework was developed, based on a systemic review of literature and an international eDelphi study, as a tool to assess the quality of clinical information in DHTs. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to assess the applicability, internal consistency, and construct validity of the CLIQ framework. METHODS: This study was conducted as a cross-sectional survey of health care professionals across the United Kingdom who regularly use SystmOne electronic health records. Participants were invited through emails and social media platforms. The CLIQ questionnaire was administered as a web-based survey. Spearman correlation coefficients were computed to investigate the linear relationship between the dimensions in the CLIQ framework. The Cronbach α coefficients were computed to assess the internal consistency of the global scale (ie, CLIQ framework) and the subscales (ie, the informativeness, availability, and usability categories). Confirmatory factor analysis was used to assess the extent to which the survey data supported the construct validity of the CLIQ framework. RESULTS: A total of 109 health care professionals completed the survey, of which two-thirds (67, 61.5%) were doctors and a quarter (26, 23.9%) were nurses or advanced nurse practitioners. Overall, the CLIQ dimensions had good quality scores except for portability, which had a modest score. The inter-item correlations were all positive and not likely due to chance. The Cronbach α coefficient for the overall CLIQ framework was 0.89 (95% CI 0.85-0.92). The confirmatory factor analysis provided a modest support for the construct validity of the CLIQ framework with the comparative fit index of 0.86 and standardized root mean square residual of 0.08. CONCLUSIONS: The CLIQ framework demonstrated a high reliability and a modest construct validity. The CLIQ framework offers a pragmatic approach to assessing the quality of clinical information in DHTs and could be applied as part of information quality assurance systems in health care settings to improve quality of health information."

      "abstract": "Introduction: Governments create policies to address societal needs and then assess their effectiveness through policy metrics. The UK Rare Diseases Framework and its England Rare Diseases Action Plans aim to improve the lives of people with lived experience of rare diseases and their carers. Reaching these goals requires more effective engagement with those least likely to interact with NHS services. This paper outlines a protocol to identify relevant high-level policy metrics while engaging underserved and underrepresented groups. Methods and Analysis: A long list of candidate metrics for the 36 Actions linked to the four Priority Areas of the Framework was compiled from government logic models. The list was discussed in three workshops, and irrelevant, ambiguous, or time-irrelevant metrics were removed. Additional metrics were identified through an evidence review and expert opinion. In the first round of a two-round eDelphi study, shortlisted metrics will be grouped into the four Priority Areas: Faster Diagnosis, Increased Healthcare Professional Awareness, Better Care Coordination, and Improved Access to Specialist Care, Treatment, and drugs. An eDelphi panel of 50 people living with rare disease or their carers, as well as 50 professional stakeholders, will rate each metric on a 1-9 scale. The sample size allows for 20% attrition. Consensus for inclusion or exclusion will be based on 70% agreement (7-9 for 'very valuable', 1-3 for 'not valuable'), with fewer than 15% rating the metric at the opposite end of the scale. Metrics will be included or excluded if consensus is reached in both groups; otherwise, they will remain under consideration in Round 2. In Round 1, eDelphi participants may propose additional metrics, which will be included in Round 2. After two rounds, a final set of policy metrics will be selected. Any discrepancies in Round 2 ratings will be explored through further research. Ethics and Dissemination: The Coventry University Group Research Ethics Committee has approved the study (P183377). The results will be disseminated to people with lived experience of rare disease and professional stakeholders through conferences, events, and newsletters and submitted to a peer-reviewed journal. If adopted, the identified metrics will inform decision-making on rare disease policies in England and beyond.

Methods: This was a mixed methods feasibility randomised controlled trial conducted online, with a pre-post, waitlist-controlled design. Primary outcomes were recruitment, completion (≥ 3 intervention sessions) and follow-up rates. At baseline, participants reported demographic information, PCOS symptoms, depression (Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)), anxiety ((Generalised Anxiety Disorder Assessment (GAD-7)), polycystic ovary syndrome health-related quality of life (PCOSQ-50), psychological wellbeing (Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale, WEMWBS) and self-efficacy (Self-Efficacy to Manage Chronic Disease Scale (SEMCD6)) before randomisation to an intervention group (IG) receiving the intervention immediately or a waitlist control group (CG) receiving the intervention 12 weeks later. PHQ-9, GAD-7, PCOSQ-50, WEMWBS and SEMDC6 were reassessed at 6 and 12 weeks. IG participants reported the usability of the digital intervention (system usability scale (SUS)) and acceptability via qualitative exit interviews. Results: Of 131 eligible, consented participants, 83% (N=109, age M=37.1, SD=8.6 years) completed baseline measures and were randomised to the IG (n=54) or the CG (n=55). Baseline clinical caseness was high for depression (n=77, 70.6%) and anxiety (n=78, 71.6 %). Twenty-one participants (39%) in the IG completed ≥3 intervention sessions. At 6-week follow-up, completion of secondary outcomes was n=32 (59%) for IG and n= 38 (69%) for CG; at 12 weeks, n=31 (57%) for IG and n= 38 (69%) for CG. Twelve IG participants took part in the exit interviews. Exploratory descriptive statistics suggest there were greater improvements in depression, anxiety, psychological wellbeing, self-efficacy and quality of life for the intervention group completers compared to the waitlist control group. SUS data and thematic analysis suggest the intervention was usable, acceptable, relevant and interesting. Participants reported experiences including feeling seen and valued, having the difficulties of lifestyle change acknowledged, and learning valuable lessons, particularly how to monitor and manage emotions, prioritise self-care and complete personal goals. Conclusions:  This novel intervention was rated as usable and acceptable, with potential for improving mental health and wellbeing outcomes. More research is needed to identify for whom the intervention is beneficial and on implementation in practice."

      "abstract": "This paper builds and extends on the authors' previous work related to the algorithmic tool, Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition (CAD), and one of its core applications, Real Quantifier Elimination (QE).  These topics are at the heart of symbolic computation and were first implemented in computer algebra systems decades ago, but have recently received renewed interest as part of the ongoing development of SMT solvers for non-linear real arithmetic. First, we consider the use of iterated univariate resultants in traditional CAD, and how this leads to inefficiencies, especially in the case of an input with multiple equational constraints.   We reproduce the workshop paper [Davenport & England, 2023], adding important clarifications to our suggestions first made there to make use of multivariate resultants in the projection phase of CAD.  We then consider an alternative approach to this problem first documented in [McCallum & Brown, 2009] which redefines the actual object under construction, albeit only in the case of two equational constraints.  We correct an unhelpful typo and provide a proof missing from that paper. We finish by revising the topic of how to deal with SMT or Real QE problems expressed using rational functions (as opposed to the usual polynomial ones) noting that these are often found in industrial applications.  We revisit a proposal made in [Uncu, Davenport and England, 2023] for doing this in the case of satisfiability, explaining why such an approach does not trivially extend to more complicated quantification structure and giving a suitable alternative."

      "abstract": "This study is part of a larger project focused on measuring, understanding, and improving student engagement in programming education. We investigate whether synthetic data generation can help identify at-risk students earlier in a small, imbalanced dataset from an introductory programming module. The analysis used anonymised records from 379 students, with 15% marked as failing, and applied several machine learning algorithms. The first experiments showed poor recall for the failing group. However, using synthetic data generation methods led to a significant improvement in performance. Our  results suggest that, when combined with synthetic data, machine learning can help identify at-risk students early in programming courses. This research lays the groundwork for validating and using these models with live student cohorts in the future, to allow for timely and effective interventions that can improve student outcomes. It also includes feature importance analysis to refine formative tasks. Overall, this study contributes to developing practical workflows that help detect disengagement early and improve student success in programming education."

Recent exploration-guided algorithms like NLSAT, NuCAD, and CAlC rely on CAD technology but reduce the computational effort heuristically. Single cell construction is a paradigm that is used in each of these algorithms.  The central property on which the CAD algorithm is based is called delineability. Recently, we introduced a weaker notion called projective delineability which can require fewer computations to guarantee, but needs to be applied carefully. This paper adapts the single cell construction for exploiting projective delineability and reports on experimental results."

The method was tested in OpenAI Gym's Mountain Car and Lunar Lander environments. Results show that these SINDy-based models can closely match the real environment's behavior while cutting down computational cost by 20–35%. With just 75 data points for Mountain Car and 1000 for Lunar Lander, the models achieved over 0.997 state-wise correlation, with very low prediction errors (as low as 3.11 × 10⁻⁶ for Mountain Car velocity and 1.42 × 10⁻⁶ for Lunar Lander position). RL agents trained in these simplified environments needed fewer steps to learn (65,075 vs. 100,000 for Mountain Car and 801,000 vs. 1,000,000 for Lunar Lander) and performed similarly to those trained in the full environments. This work offers a fast and accurate way to create interpretable models for use in model-based RL."

      "abstract": "Building control systems typically use either setpoint regulation, where controllers determine optimal setpoints for low-level systems, or direct actuator control, which bypasses the setpoint layer. Despite widespread hierarchical approaches, empirical evidence comparing these strategies remains limited. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of both paradigms using reinforcement learning (RL) with the Building Optimization Performance Test (BOPTEST) framework. We implement and compare: (1) setpoint-trained RL agents using PPO, DQN, and A2C algorithms, (2) direct actuation-controlled RL agents with identical algorithms, and (3) a conventional PI controller baseline. Experiments span two simulation environments (BESTEST Hydronic Heat Pump and BESTEST Air systems) with constant electricity pricing. Results demonstrate that setpoint regulation achieves near-perfect thermal comfort (> 99% discomfort reduction) with modest energy cost increases (4.8–5.0%), while direct actuator control offers smaller energy penalties (1.8–3.2%) with substantial comfort improvements (> 80% discomfort reduction). Most significantly, setpoint regulation consistently demonstrated faster learning, requiring 48–79% fewer training steps across algorithms and environments. The setpoint-trained approach also exhibited 38% lower control signal variance (measured as the standard deviation of actuator commands) over the 14-day testing period. These findings provide quantitative evidence supporting a two-level control architecture, where an RL agent optimizes setpoints for existing low-level controllers, while also identifying conditions where direct actuator control by an RL agent may be advantageous. Our research contributes valuable empirical insights for designing energy-efficient building control strategies using reinforcement learning, with setpoint regulation offering significant advantages in training efficiency and control stability."

      "abstract": "Objective: This paper aims to address the challenges in abstract screening within systematic reviews (SR) by leveraging the zero-shot capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Methods: We employ LLM to prioritize candidate studies by aligning abstracts with the selection criteria outlined in an SR protocol. Abstract screening was transformed into a novel question-answering (QA) framework, treating each selection criterion as a question addressed by LLM. The framework involves breaking down the selection criteria into multiple questions, properly prompting LLM to answer each question, scoring and re-ranking each answer, and combining the responses to make nuanced inclusion or exclusion decisions. Results and Discussion: Large-scale validation was performed on the benchmark of CLEF eHealth 2019 Task 2: Technology-Assisted Reviews in Empirical Medicine. Focusing on GPT-3.5 as a case study, the proposed QA framework consistently exhibited a clear advantage over traditional information retrieval approaches and bespoke BERT-family models that were fine-tuned for prioritizing candidate studies (ie, from the BERT to PubMedBERT) across 31 datasets of 4 categories of SRs, underscoring their high potential in facilitating abstract screening. The experiments also showcased the viability of using selection criteria as a query for reference prioritization. The experiments also showcased the viability of the framework using different LLMs. Conclusion: Investigation justified the indispensable value of leveraging selection criteria to improve the performance of automated abstract screening. LLMs demonstrated proficiency in prioritizing candidate studies for abstract screening using the proposed QA framework. Significant performance improvements were obtained by re-ranking answers using the semantic alignment between abstracts and selection criteria. This further highlighted the pertinence of utilizing selection criteria to enhance abstract screening."

      "abstract": "As climate change intensifies, determining a developing region's role in achieving net-zero emissions worldwide is crucial. However, regional efforts, considering historical emissions, remain underexplored. Here, we assess energy system changes, technology adoption, and investments needed for developing regions, including five major- and minor-emitting nations. Our analysis, using an integrated assessment model, shows a large gap in regional efforts toward global net-zero emissions, stemming from the necessary shift of energy systems to low-carbon resources. The use of new technologies, like electric vehicles, hydrogen, and carbon capture, varies by region, with the highest adoption required between 2020 and 2030. Financing this shift needs an average gross domestic product (GDP) investment rise of 0.464% in minor-emitting regions and up to 2.1% in major-emitting regions by 2085. Our results could guide policies and support setting quantifiable targets for developing nations. The findings are key to facilitating strategic technology use and finance mobilization to achieve a carbon-neutral future."

      "abstract": "Community micro-grid energy projects are needed to drive de-carbonisation and increase equity of energy systems among displaced communities. However, micro-grid solutions are often inflexible and lack functionality to respond to displaced community energy needs and ensure the long-term sustainability of interventions. This paper explores the use of fog-computing retrofit architectures deployed on community micro-grid infrastructures to enable flexible demand management to improve service delivery and longevity. A micro-services solution is proposed that decouples components increasing resilience and testability while allowing hybrid edge-cloud deployments. The architecture is outlined and demonstrated for a micro-grid providing energy to two nurseries and a playground in Kigeme refugee camp, Rwanda. To enact the community priorities within the demand management system, modified Genetic Algorithm (GA) methods are outlined and tested for different use-case scenarios. The performance of the modified GA methods are then compared with a pre-existing battery protect controller and an alternative deterministic (space-shared) energy manager model. A modified search space GA method was required for GA to outperform both the existing battery controller and proposed deterministic method in terms of achieving the highest utility function in almost every use-case. The results further showed how simple community priorities can be set and used to enact control on the system in 24h timeframes that are in line with the local decision-making context."

      "abstract": "Historically, SW practice has not always met Black children’s identity needs. In the 70s, it was standard practice to place Black children in white homes. In 2002, legal policy was amended to emphasize children's religion, race, and culture in finding permanent homes. However, in 2014 the legal requirement to consider ethnicity was removed, allowing transracial placements. Many frontline social workers did not agree with this change, arguing that by removing ethnicity, the law devalued the significance of ethnicity to individual children’s identity. Against this backdrop of policy U-turns, and funded by the National Lottery Heritage Fund, this heritage project explores Black SWs historical navigations around identity – how did they perceive and experience these changes?"

      "abstract": "All children need permanent, caring and secure homes in which they can grow and thrive. There are more than 4500 Muslim-heritage children in the UK who cannot live with their biological families. For some of these children, ethnically and religiously matched homes can lead to more secure futures; however, there is a shortage of Muslim-heritage carers. This article examines the reasons for the lack of Muslim-heritage adopters or foster carers in the UK by combining understandings from Islamic religious texts, contemporary British social work practice, and sociological analysis of children's experiences. The empirical findings presented here are based on semi-structured qualitative interviews (n = 41) with various professionals and carers involved in the care of Muslim-heritage children. Our evidence uncovers specific socio-cultural, political and theological barriers that hinder carers of Muslim backgrounds from coming forward to adopt or foster. By better understanding these barriers, this article provides an evidence base to inform social work policy and practice to enhance recruitment of carers from Muslim backgrounds. The data presented in the paper also contributes to raising awareness within Social Work practice and Muslim communities around the needs of vulnerable children, to improve their life outcomes."

      "abstract": "Despite the increasing prevalence of artificial intelligence (AI) ethics frameworks, the practical application of these frameworks in industrial settings remains limited. This limitation is further augmented in energy systems by the complexity of systems composition and systems operation for energy generation, distribution, and supply. The primary reason for this limitation is the gap between the conceptual notion of ethics principles and the technical performance of AI applications in energy systems. For instance, trust is featured prominently in ethics frameworks but pertains to limited relevance for the robust operation of a smart grid. In this paper, we propose a lifecycle approach for AI ethics that aims to address this gap. The proposed approach consists of four phases: design, development, operation, and evaluation. All four phases are supported by a central AI ethics repository that gathers and integrates the primary and secondary dimensions of ethical practice, including reliability, safety, and trustworthiness, from design through to evaluation. This lifecycle approach is closely aligned with the operational lifecycle of energy systems, from design and production through to use, maintenance, repair, and overhaul, followed by shutdown, recycling, and replacement. Across these lifecycle stages, an energy system engages with numerous human stakeholders, directly with designers, engineers, users, trainers, operators, and maintenance technicians, as well as indirectly with managers, owners, policymakers, and community groups. This lifecycle approach is empirically evaluated in the complex energy system of a multi-campus tertiary education institution where the alignment between ethics and technical performance, as well as the human-centric application of AI, are demonstrated."

      "abstract": "This research report draws on original research to explore how care-experienced children and young people from minoritised backgrounds understand their identities. Through their narratives, we understand how children in care experience and perceive their identities, as well as their understandings of the care that they receive and desire for their identities. We rely on children’s and young people’s voices and stories. Using an intersectional approach, we worked with Black, Asian and mixed-heritage children and young people (aged 14 to 19) to understand their narratives of identity. We focused firstly on understandings of ethnicity and religion and how these change in relation to other aspects of identity and, crucially, by being in care. Secondly, we examined their experiences of asking and getting help from social workers, foster carers, adopters and other support structures that provide for their identities while in care. By listening to and understanding children and young people’s perspectives around ethnicity, religion and identity, we developed a new framework to inform both theoretical and practical work with children in care. We describe our model as Identities in-Flux, which integrates Kimberlé Crenshaw’s Intersectionality and Meredith McGuires’ Lived Religion theories to generate new frameworks of reference that support best practice when implementing support plans for young people and children. Within this model, we consider the interplay of changing socio-ethnic-religious factors, as well as young people and children’s biological heritage, their being in care and their own agency in determining how they themselves want to be perceived. By broadening discussion from a singular focus on one aspect of identity, such as race or gender, we hope to support inclusive and sensitive practices and policies that reflect and respond to the increasing diversity of children and young people entering care."

      "abstract": "Fly-in faculty (FF) mode of teaching plays a crucial part of Transnational Education (TNE) and is widely prevalent as part of international higher education, offering cross-border delivery of curriculum. In this paper, we studied the student learning experience of the FF within a franchised transnational business programme in Qatar. A total of twenty-five recent graduates were interviewed to provide contextual data into their learning experiences with FF. The findings revealed five key themes: communication difficulties, subject matter expertise, authenticity, impersonal relationships, and inaccessibility. Despite communication and accessibility concerns, students reported high satisfaction levels with the FF model and would opt to continue with this policy. Generally, the findings suggest positive overall learning outcomes despite perceived difficulties, thus serving as a catalyst for change. This study offers TNE administrators, policy makers and practitioners’ valuable insights and a greater appreciation of the learning experiences of global TNE students to support improvements for TNE pedagogy and enhanced student learning outcomes. Theoretically, the study deepens our understanding of the FF mode of teaching and suggests that when faced with disorienting dilemmas, TNE students positively and realistically balance the pros and cons of this mode of teaching."

      "abstract": "Our study evaluates academic performance, motivations, and experiences of technical college students in a top-up university degree program at a Qatari-based UK transnational education provider. Using a mixed-methods approach, we analyzed academic performance through one-way ANOVA of 53 students, comparing their grades with peers who began their degree programs in the first year. Interviews with 14 top-up students explored their motivations and learning experiences. The results indicate no significant differences in academic performance between the groups, affirming the equivalence of technical college students to traditional peers. Interviews revealed three distinct categories of student experiences, highlighting both academic and non-academic factors that shape their transition. This study challenges assumptions about vocational students’ preparedness for higher education, demonstrating their capability to succeed academically. It emphasizes the need for tailored institutional support to enhance student experiences in top-up programs, including financial aid, improved student life, and the integration of practical and academic teaching methods. Additionally, fostering inclusive environments, strengthening inter-institutional collaboration, and ensuring high-quality program delivery are critical to supporting student mobility and contributing to Qatar’s knowledge-based economy. These findings provide valuable insights for developing effective pathways for vocational-to-academic transitions in higher education."

      "abstract": "Although few studies have been conducted on entrepreneurial mindset among students in the higher education sector, most of them have tried to explain the entrepreneurial mindset of students from traits and skills perspective. Considering that the results of these studies are unreliable in predicting the entrepreneurial mindset; using a cognitive approach, we investigated the formation of the entrepreneurial mindset among higher education students in Iran by considering the effect of latent variables of entrepreneurial environmental support, education, and methods and the mediating role of entrepreneurial inspirations. Our sample included 436 university students from management faculties in Iranian higher education institutions. The results of showed that the latent variables of entrepreneurial environmental support, education and inspiration had a positive and significant effect on the entrepreneurial mindset of students in the higher education sector in Iran. However, the effect of entrepreneurial education methods on the entrepreneurial mindset was not confirmed. In addition, the results of the study confirmed the indirect effect of entrepreneurial education (formal and non-formal) through entrepreneurial inspiration on the entrepreneurial mindset of those students. This research, while filling the gap in studies on entrepreneurial mindset among students, especially in a developing country like Iran, has appropriate practical implications for government and educational policymakers. For this purpose, formal and non-formal education courses can be held, entrepreneurial events can be organized, and entrepreneurs can be invited to attend universities and higher education institutions to develop the entrepreneurial mindset of students."

      "abstract": "Lithium plating in lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is one of the main causes of safety accidents in electric vehicles (EVs). The study of intelligent machine learning-based lithium plating detection and warning algorithms for LIBs is of great importance. Therefore, this paper proposes an intelligent lithium plating detection and early warning method for LIBs based on the random forest model. This method can accurately detect lithium plating during the charging process of LIBs, and play an early warning role according to the detection results. First, pulse charging experiments of LIBs, including normal and lithium plating charging tests, were completed and validated using in situ characterization methods. Second, the normalized internal resistance from the pulse charging test is used to detect lithium plating in LIBs. Third, a lithium plating feature extraction method is proposed to address the lack of useful lithium plating information for LIBs during the charging process. Finally, the Random Forest machine learning technique is used to classify and predict the lithium plating of LIBs. The model validation results show that the detection accuracy of lithium plating is greater than 97.2%. This is of significance for the study of intelligent lithium plating detection algorithms for LIBs."

      "abstract": "Wide bandgap Gallium Nitride (GaN) technology promises to deliver the next generation of power transistors capable of high energy density and compact design integration however, without active monitoring high failing rates are recorded due to its instability to design parameter variations. Moreover, the electromagnetic (EM) radiofrequency (RF) emissions due to GaN power switching require extra design resources. Considering the extensive research area dedicated to galvanic isolated magnetic sensors for GaN wafer monolithic integration with usage in power monitoring, this study investigates the conditions that a Hall sensor is required to meet when operating in close proximity of a GaN transistor. Through considerable experimental testing, it was determined that the sensor requires a magnetic field starting from ±1 mT when interfaced with a microcontroller. Additionally, since the GaN transistor's EM RF switching noise was one of the most monitored parameters during the experiments, it was discovered that it is proportional to the transistor's current transfer area whereas its magnitude is due to electrical current required by the load. As a result of these findings, the EM radiated switching noise may apply to all electrical switches and provide a significant advantage when designing for EM compatibility (EMC)."

      "abstract": "The existing body of research on battery state of health has identified various degradation modes for the electrolyte, yet very few studies have explored the role of electrolyte colour changes as a diagnostic tool for state of health (SOH). This study investigates the impact of elevated temperatures and its correlation with electrolyte colour changes and capacity fade during cycling. Specifically, the research examines whether cycling cells at elevated temperatures induces noticeable changes in electrolyte colour and whether these changes can be linked to the SOH of the cells. The methodology employs in operando optical sensors to monitor real-time colour shifts in the electrolyte, aiming to demonstrate a qualitative relationship between electrolyte colour change, degradation, thermal ageing, and capacity fade, laying the foundations for future quantitative assessment of the relationships identified. Our research builds upon these findings by offering a novel approach that integrates optical sensing to provide real-time visual evidence of electrolyte degradation and colour change during cell operation. The results demonstrate a clear relationship between elevated temperature, electrolyte colour change, and capacity fade, leading to accelerated degradation. This approach offers a new insight over traditional in exitu battery diagnostics, as it enables continuous in operando monitoring of electrolyte colour change and has the potential to unlock a detailed understanding of the chemical reactions and electrolyte breakdown during cycling."

      "abstract": "Copper-doped Manganese Dioxide has been synthesised through a simple hydrothermal method at different doping levels. The synthesised materials have been characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to determine the composition, structure, and morphology. All the Cu doped MnO2 are found to be single phased. Their electrochemical properties as cathode for Zinc-ion batteries are studied by cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvano-static charge / discharge (GCD) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), using 3 M ZnSO4 + 0.3 MnSO4 solution as the electrolyte. 3.8% Cu doped MnO2 has shown the highest initial capacity of 379.5 mAh g−1 at 0.02 A·g−1, and 304.4 mA h g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, but experienced fast fading with a poor capacity retention of 56.8% after 100 cycles. 7.4% Cu doping gives lower capacity, while 5.9% doping shows a higher discharging capacity (320.0 mAh·g−1 at 0.02 A·g−1 and 269.3 mAh·g−1 at 0.5 A·g−1) and improved stability (85.8% capacity retention after 100 cycles), better than non-doped MnO2 electrode (284.4 mAh g−1 at 0.02 A g−1 and 252.1 mAh·g−1 at 0.5 A g−1, capacity retention 76.7%). The samples show satisfactory capacity and rate capability while the cycling stability is not ideal, which may relate to the needle like morphology and nanoscale particle size. CV tests revealed that the electrochemical process is mainly diffusion controlled. The zinc ion diffusion coefficient is tested to be in the range of 10−12 cm2·s−1 from both CV and EIS tests and showed the same trend in their electrochemical capacity. Doping of Copper in MnO2 reduced the polarization on electrode, improved the electrochemical reversibility, as evidenced by the reduction of the redox peak potential difference from 0.31 to 0.24 V at 1.1 mV·s−1, and from 0.45 V to 0.31 V at 5 mV·s−1. Whilst the cell resistance of non-doped MnO2 increased from 1.78 Ω to 7.39 Ω after cycling, the cell resistances of all Cu-doped cathodes reduced, indicating improved electronic conductivities after cycling. These results indicate that Cu-doping is effective to increase the conductivity of the materials, reduce the polarization during charge and discharge, and improve the cycling stability of MnO2 cathode."

      "abstract": "This work addresses multistationarity of fully open reaction networks equipped with mass action kinetics. We improve upon existing results relating existence of positive feedback loops in a reaction network and multistationarity; and we provide a novel deterministic operation to generate new non-multistationary networks. This is interesting because while there were many operations to create infinitely many new multistationary networks from a multistationary example, this is the first such operation for the non-multistationary counterpart. Such tools for the generation of example networks have a use-case in the application of data science to reaction network theory.  We demonstrate this by using new data, along with a novel graph representation of reaction networks that is unique up to a permutation on the name of species of the network, to train a graph attention neural network model to predict multistationarity of reaction networks. This is the first time machine learning tools are used for studying classification problems of reaction networks."

The results are given for the general mathematical formalism of a parametric system of equations and therefore can be used in other application areas."

We consider here parametrized systems of polynomial equations that are linear in enough parameters, and provide a Kac-Rice formula for the expected number of solutions of the system when the parameters follow continuous distributions. Combined with Monte Carlo integration, we apply the formula to partition the parameter region according to the number of solutions or find a region in parameter space where the system has the maximal number of solutions. The motivation stems from the study of steady states of chemical reaction networks and gives new tools for the open problem of identifying the parameter region where the network has at least two positive steady states. We illustrate with numerous examples that our approach successfully handles a larger number of parameters than exact methods."

One may expect that by increasing the dispersal rate between the patches, the system would become more well-mixed hence simpler, however we show that it is not always the case, and the number of steady states may (temporarily) increase by increasing the dispersal rate. Besides sequences of pitchfork and saddle-node bifurcations, we find triple-transcritical bifurcations and also a sun-ray shaped bifurcation where twelve steady states meet at a single point then disappear."

      "abstract": "We propose a differential radial basis function (RBF) network termed RBF-DiffNet—whose hidden layer blocks are partial differential equations (PDEs) linear in terms of the RBF—to make the baseline RBF network robust to noise in sequential data. Assuming that the sequential data derives from the discretisation of the solution to an underlying PDE, the differential RBF network learns constant linear coefficients of the PDE, consequently regularising the RBF network by following modified backward-Euler updates. We experimentally validate the differential RBF network on the logistic map chaotic timeseries as well as on 30 real-world timeseries provided by Walmart in the M5 forecasting competition. The proposed model is compared with the normalised and unnormalised RBF networks, ARIMA, and ensembles of multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and recurrent networks with long short-term memory (LSTM) blocks. From the experimental results, RBF-DiffNet consistently shows a marked reduction in the prediction error over the baseline RBF network (e.g., 41% reduction in the root mean squared scaled error on the M5 dataset, and 53% reduction in the mean absolute error on the logistic map); RBF-DiffNet also shows a comparable performance to the LSTM ensemble but requires 99% less computational time. Our proposed network consequently enables more accurate predictions—in the presence of observational noise—in sequence modelling tasks such as timeseries forecasting that leverage the model interpretability, fast training, and function approximation properties of the RBF network."

      "abstract": "Car-cabin thermal systems, including heated seats, air-conditioning, and radiant panels, use a large proportion of the energy budget of electric vehicles and thus reduce their effective range. Optimising these systems and their controllers might be possible with computationally efficient simulation. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art simulators are either too slow or provide little resolution of the cabin's thermal environment. In this work, we propose a novel approach to developing a fast simulation by machine learning (ML) from measurements within the car cabin over a number of trials within a climatic wind tunnel. A range of ML approaches are tried and compared. The best-performing ML approach is compared to more traditional 1D simulation in terms of accuracy and speed. The resulting simulation, based on Multivariate Linear Regression, is fast (5 microseconds per simulation second), and yields good accuracy (NRMSE 1.8%), which exceeds the performance of the traditional 1D simulator. Furthermore, the simulation is able to differentially simulate the thermal environment of the footwell versus the head and the driver position versus the front passenger seat, but unlike a traditional 1D model cannot support changes to the physical structure. This fast method for obtaining computationally efficient simulators of car cabins will accelerate adoption of techniques such as Deep Reinforcement Learning for climate control."

      "abstract": "To address the need for improved access to energy and meet the United Nations Clean Energy Challenge (2019), humanitarian agencies require robust, valid, and meaningful data that documents the everyday energy practices of displaced people. Collecting data through sensor monitoring is one way of providing quality energy data that will aid humanitarian actors in designing and delivering sustainable affordable energy solutions. Using the case of the design and deployment of 20 stove use monitors (SUM) in Kigeme refugee camp in Rwanda, this paper discusses the benefits and limitations of collecting data on cookstove usage using wireless sensors in refugee settlements., Central to the discussion is the value of reflexivity or critical reflection to uncover significant knowledge gaps that can apply more generally to the problem of designing and deploying sensor systems for the displaced setting. If sensor monitoring systems are to collect data that aid appropriate energy planning and support technology development in the humanitarian sector, we contend improvements in sensor design and deployment protocols are needed to accommodate the displaced setting's cultural, economic, and political complexity. These improvements include the uptake of sensor monitoring design that embeds ethical, progressive, and inclusive protocols when working in the displaced setting."

      "abstract": "BackgroundManagement of citizen science engagement during a force majeure needs very careful consideration in order not to lose precious time. This paper serves as a guide for pro-action in the event of another virus-enforced stay-at-home, movement-control order and presents necessary changes undertaken by an international collaboration during a once-in-a-hundred years' pandemic that reduced face-to-face public interactions. Overcoming challenges imposed under force majeure conditions, a citizen science project funded under the EU Horizon2020 research and innovation scheme SwafS15-2019, rethought experiential learning through volunteering screen time.MethodsMitigation measures, to limit the handicap of moving to online working reducing potential for learning through synchronous live engagement, included creation of an interactive multilingual informal five-step learning resource (CSI-COP MOOC: 'Your Right to Privacy Online'), adapting Greenpeace's 'Big Plastic Count' to an online 'Big Cookie Count' event, as well as webinars organised by project partners in their local language, Newsletters, provided opportunities for the general public to gain vital knowledge about protecting personal data and preserving online privacy.ResultsOver one-hundred and ninety members of the public who completed CSI-COP's MOOC with a certificate, participated in one-to-one online 'walk through' training sessions in local languages joined the project, through GDPR-compliant written informed consent, as citizen scientists. The acquisition of practical skills by these individuals enabled investigations of websites they visited and apps they used to record third-party cookies or third-party requests for personal data.ConclusionsThe effective reorganisation of CSI-COP activities to online, then hybrid once COVID-19 restrictions were lifted, ensured the expected deliverables were produced. Citizen scientists' contributions realised a searchable Repository of investigated websites and apps, a Taxonomy of tracking cookies, two policy briefs on improving monitoring of GDPR compliance, and Guidelines to address the 'legitimate interest' principle used by third parties to gather personal data online."

      "abstract": "Inclusive citizen science is an emerging research topic that has been extensively studied in recent years. However, most of the previous studies focused on the development of theoretical models and practical strategies that scholars can employ to attract diverse populations to their citizen science (CS) projects. Their findings were mostly based on either conceptual ethical frameworks or empirical observations of the scholars after the completion of the specific CS project. Few studies collected socio-demographic and behavioral data of the active citizens involved in a CS project to analyze the diversity of citizens in CS.  However, to the best of our knowledge, having reviewed numerous peer-reviewed papers, none of the previous studies attempted to use prospective citizen scientists’ traits to investigate intrinsic factors that may help increase the active engagement and diversity in CS. This paper presents a new inclusive citizen science engagement model based on quantitative analysis of surveys administered to 540 participants of the dedicated free informal education course ‘Your Right to Privacy Online’ (MOOC - a massive online open course) from eight countries in the EU funded project, CSI-COP (Citizen Scientists Investigating Cookies and App GDPR compliance). The surveys were filled out just after completing the training stage and before joining the project as active citizen scientists. Out of the 540 participants who completed the surveys analyzed in this study, only 170 (32%) individuals actively participated as citizen scientists in the project. Therefore, the study attempted to understand what characterizes these participants compared to those who decided to refrain from joining the project after the training stage. This study’s findings revealed several important relationships and predictors for becoming a citizen scientist based on the surveys analysis, such as age, gender, culture, education, Internet accessibility and apps usage, as well as the satisfaction with the MOOC, the mode of training and initial intentions for becoming a citizen scientist. These findings lead to the development of the empirical model for inclusive engagement in CS and enhance the understanding of the internal factors that influence individuals' intention and actual participation as citizen scientists. The devised model offers valuable insights for designing inclusive recruitment strategies, fostering positive learning experiences, addressing technological barriers, bridging the intention-engagement gap, and tailoring engagement strategies to accommodate ethnic and cultural diversity."
